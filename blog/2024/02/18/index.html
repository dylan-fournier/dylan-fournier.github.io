                <p>I was watchin adventure time with my BF and he often compares the show's weirdness to spongebob, but then it just gets out of hand.</p>
                <p>Like apparantly in one episode people are replaced by versions of themselves that hate mayo and unalive people who ask about it? i've never seen the show and the concept confuses me</p>
                <p>He also refrences a bunch of other shows a lot of the time, but its kinda fun cause then he just describes an episode of a show in very basic terms.</p>
