        <p>Hope everyone had a good family day. I went to the mall with mine and we went to a bunch of different stores, and looked at so many cool things. I bought a shirt.</p>
        <p>In other news, i am super stressed about the coding competition on wednesday, because it was 10$ for my teacher, and i feel like i'm gonna do really poorly. 
            We can't even look stuff up on w3 schools, we only get access to the official python documentation, which if you've ever used it, it is not the most searchable thing ever.</p>
        <p>I never thought i would have to study for computer science class (in high school) but here we are. (its not technically for class but whatevz still counts)</p>
        <p>Despite being nervous i am still excited, and even if i do poorly i will have fun trying to solve the puzzles, i love stuff like that.</p>
        <p>Sorry for the rant bloggers, i promised a book review today but it'll have to be tommorow.</p>
        <p>Sleep Well!</p>
