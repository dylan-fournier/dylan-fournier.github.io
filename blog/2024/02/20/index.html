        <p>I promised a book review so a book review you shall get:</p>
        <p>Solitaire (alice oseman) centers around tori spring who just went to school or something i dont really
            remember the start.
            So she is sad and stuff and follows these sticky notes to a computer that says "solitare" on it. and it leads to a blog(!)
            another guy named michael comes in and they hang out a bunch. she has to try and figure out who is running solitare and stop them before they do bad things.
            theres a bunch of links to heartstopper which was fun for me as someone who watched it, and i quite enjoyed the book overall. <br>
        </p>
            <p>i would give a score of 6/7, but the book does definately conver some serious stuff so be warned.</p>
        <p>in other news, i have avoided studying for cs and drama tomorrow by going through every piece of clothing i have so that is fun, they are all sorted now by color.</p>
    <p>i should really study now...</p>
